/*
 * A Class is User defined Reference type. 
 * It comes with OOP features like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction. 
 * It can contains data as well as functions to manipulate the data. 
 * Usually the data is hidden.(Accessible only within the class). 
 * We can use Functions or Properties(Getters/Setters) to access the private data. 
 * Classes are created to have composite data types and functions to perform real time operations.
 * Since C# 4.0, we have automatic properties which are public accessors to the hidden private fields. In this case, developers need not create private fields, it will be internally available for those properties. 
 * U can also have nested classes. Practically, we use nested classes if the class is intended to be used only within that class.
 * A class in C# will usually have fields(hidden data), methods(Functions to manipulate the data), Properties(Accessors to the data) and Events(Actions on the object). 
 * Events are created using a concept called DELEGATES. 
 * Members of a class can be instance based(Accessible only thru objects) or non instance based(Accessible by the Name of the class).
 * As C# does not support global functions, we can compensate it using static members as there will no instance specific operations, it shall be common to all. Instance based members are scoped to the object thru which they are working with.
